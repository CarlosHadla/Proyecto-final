## Work Methodology

We have adopted the agile methodology 'Scrum', using tools such as Trello for task management. This methodology allows us to address complexities with short iterations and incremental deliveries, promoting flexibility, constant adaptation, and collaboration between teams.

Week 1: This stage constitutes the project's kickoff and data handling. Objectives, project scopes, as well as KPIs to evaluate, are outlined. Additionally, preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted on the data.

Week 2: Data Engineering stage. The data warehouse is created, implemented, and automated. Additionally, the Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) for the dashboard and preliminary Machine Learning models are proposed.

Week 3: Final stage. Primarily completing the dashboard and presenting the Machine Learning product. Additionally, delivering documentation and the complete repository.

## Dashboard
The following dashboard summarizes the key results obtained during the implementation project of electric vehicles in the transportation fleet of 'NewYorkDrive'.

Five sheets have been created:

1) 'Statistics', displaying the general business statistics over the past 10 years.
2) 'ROI', where the return on investment is analyzed comparatively between combustion and electric cars. For both cases, the net profits were predicted using the Machine Learning model, and investment and fuel costs were calculated based on the obtained data.
3) 'Route Efficiency', evaluating average trip times, distances traveled, and exploring potential route efficiency improvements through various graphs and applications.
4) 'Fuel Costs', analyzing the difference in charging costs between a combustion car and electric cars, clearly reflecting a decrease in fuel costs if the fleet switches to electric vehicles.
5) 'Emission Reduction', where we analyze both the gases emitted by the cars and the sound pollution in the city.
